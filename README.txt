MACVETH is a source-to-source compiler from C/C++ codes to SIMD. It is platform
dependent.

* Main dependencies:
--------------------
- Clang 10.0

* Getting started:
------------------

Simple guide to get started with the compiler.

** Compilation of the project:
------------------------------

Recommended steps for a clean building of the project:

$> mkdir build
$> CXX=[C++ compiler] CC=[C compiler] cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
$> make

This will create an executable in the same folder called 'macveth'

** Executing:
------------

User may execute the compiler just typing:

$> ./macveth <input_file.c>

For displaying all the available options, type:

$> ./macveth --help

* CLI Options:
--------------

In this section we will comment in detail all the options available:

    --debug: Print debug comments, from TAC creation to the backend generator
    --debug-file=<file>: Print debug output to file
    --fma: FMA support in the architecture
    --input-cdag=<file>: Input file with placements for the CDAG
    --macro-free: The backend will generate intrinsics and will not use the
                  Vector API for generating SIMD code
    --march=<arch>: Target architecture
    --misa=<isa>: Target ISA
    -o=<output>: Output file, otherwise macveth_output.c
    -p=<path>: Build path

* Region-of-interest in our code:
----------------------------------

The compiler recognizes the region-of-interest (ROI from now on) by the
delimitation of the pragmas:

    #pragma macveth [options]
    // code
    #pragma endmacveth

Available options are:

    - nounroll: avoid unrolling the code within. This may be useful if we have a
      irregular code and we just want to vectorize it

Pragmas to be implemented (soon):

    - unroll_factor [val1] [[val2] [...]]: explicitly tell the compiler the unroll
      factor of each dimension of the nested loop/s
    - hw_alignment [array_name1] [val1] [[array_name2] [val2] [...]]: hint
      regarding the alignment factor for an array, e.g. A 64 means that we can
      can assume that A[0] % 64 = 0. Per array option.
    - tc {>|>=|=|<|<=} [val]: hint regarding the trip count of the loop, i.e.
      the expected number of iterations. Per loop option.

* Limitations/restrictions and assumptions:
-------------------------------------------

This the list of restrictions and assumptions that the user must take into
account when using this compiler:

    - ISA support:
        + Currently only working for AVX2 ISA architectures

    - Types:
        + Pointers are not allowed at the moment, e.g.:
            (*S) = (*S) + A[i];

          This may be a common scenario when writing reductions in the code
          (when passing variables to the function by reference). You can simply
          avoid this issue by using a temporal variable.

    - Loop related:
        + Only "for" loops are supported
        + Initialization of variables within the loop is allowed, e.g.:
                for (int i = 0; ...
        + There are no increments in the body of the loop of the region of
          interest, i.e. the loop condition is only incremented in the for
          statement
        + One #pragma per set of loop nests, e.g.:

            This is correct:

            #pragma macveth
            for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            }
            #pragma endmacveth
            #pragma macveth
            for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
                    ...
                }
            }
            #pragma endmacveth

            This is not:

            #pragma macveth
            for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) {
                for (int j = 0; j < M; ++j) {
                    ...
                }
            }
            #pragma endmacveth
