* Terminology:
--------------

Some terms which will be used in this document:

    * Set:
    * Case: certain configuration or setup of a program to evaluate. It can be
      composed of more than one file

* How to write new tests:
-------------------------

There are two main sets: unittest and fulltest.
You will want to add a new test for testing the shape of the code itself by
creating a new case in 'unittest'

    * Original code: for being compiled by macveth
    * SIMD code: the expected output to be compared to macveth's output

If you want to assess the correctness of a certain code being produced, you will
want to write the code in 'fulltest'. You will just have to write a file:

    * Original code: you will use a template created for this, using the
      PolyBench-style kernels. This way is easier to compare the outputs
