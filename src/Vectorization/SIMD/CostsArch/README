# Syntax:
---------

These files follow a CSV-style format. Each ISA contains a set of rows which
follow the next pattern:

Architecture,Operation,Latency,[Throughput, NumUnits,]Pattern

Therefore, rows must have 4 or 6 fields. Comments starting with # are allowed.
For a specific architecture if the value is not specified, the UNDEF value will
be used. UNDEF values must be placed at the beggining of the file. All
arithmetic operations, at least, must be set; as well as the memory operations.
