# DEPRECATED Syntax:
--------------------

These files follow a CSV-style format. Each architecture contains a set of rows
which follow the next pattern:

Arch,Op,Latency,[Throughput, NUnits,[NInst]],SIMD_Pattern

Where:
    - Arch: particular architecture. UNDEF if not defined.
    - Op: name of the operation.
    - Latency: number of cycles used to execute that instruction.
    - Throughput (optional): cycles needed to execute another equal instruction.
    - NUnits: number of units available to execute that instruction in that
      particular architecture.
    - NInst: number of instructions needed to execute that SIMD instruction.
    - SIMD_Pattern: pseudo-pattern used by MACVETH in order to add prefixes,
      suffixes, etc. Its form:

        _mm#W_#P<name_operation>#S_#D

        #W: width
        #P: preffix of the operation (optional)
        #S: suffix of the operation (optional)
        #D: data type of the operation

        This particular syntax is done thinking about Intel Intrinsics format.

Therefore, rows must have 4 or 6 fields. Comments starting with # are allowed.
For a specific architecture if the value is not specified, the UNDEF value will
be used. UNDEF values must be placed at the beginning of the file. All
arithmetic operations, at least, must be set; as well as the memory operations.
