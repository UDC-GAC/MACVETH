In order to execute vector operations, hardware need to have data in vector 
registers. Moving data between memory and registers has, of course, a cost, 
difficult to measure and quantify in most cases. Compilers may generate 
different instructions for different architectures using the same ISA (e.g. 
AVX2), according to a cost model.
