In order to execute vector operations, hardware need to align data in vector 
registers. Moving data between memory and registers has, of course, a cost, 
in most cases difficult to measure and quantify due to data races in code, 
cache complexity, out-of-order engines and port decoding occupancy. Compilers 
may generate different instructions for different architectures using the same 
ISA (e.g. AVX2), according to a cost model. From stated above, it is difficult 
to create an accurate
