This chapter is structured as follows.
\section{Front-end}
\section{Middle-end}
\section{Back-end}
In order to synthesize the vector operations gathered in the VectorIR, there
must exists a target-specific backend for each ISA. MACVETH disposes a general
interface called \texttt{SIMDBackEnd}. This interface must be
implemented by each architecture and/or ISA in order to generate
target-specific code for each machine or system.

Furthermore, each backend has a table with costs for all instructions and 
operations, and their intrinsics equivalence, if they have. This table is 
generated from data gathered in~\cite{bib:uops} and~\cite{bib:intrinsics}. 
Thus, data for each ISA and architecture are provided to the compiler in 
separate files. It is at runtime when compiler decides what file to read.
