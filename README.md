# MACVETH
This compiler attemps to vectorize properly loops by performing a source-to-source translation from standard C/C++ to C/Intrinsics. It uses Clang for AST parsing and, therefore, finding regions of interest (ROI). 

**MACVETH** stands for **M**ulti-**A**rray **C**-compiler for **VE**ctorization and **T**ranslation for **H**igh-performance computing. Besides, Macbeth, tragedy written by William Shakespeare, represents the detrimental effects of human's narcissism and vanity when looking for the power for its own benefits. In contraposition, MACVETH is composed of many components seeking for a common purpose: optimize vectorization. Last but not least, the first and last letter of the acronym stand for the name of the main author (**M**arcos **H**orro).
