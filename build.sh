# Whether perform testing or not
if [[ $testing == "testing" ]]; then
    # Testing is performed using CTest, taking full advantage of CMake suite.
    # Therefore, testing can be called either using Makefile or ctest. For
    # simplicity, I think using Makefile is better, as there are no input
    # parameters, only make test. Anyways, ctest could be done using something like:
    # OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 ctest --rerun-failed
    ctest
    [ $status -eq 0 ] && echo "TESTING command was successful" || echo "TESTING failed"
    exit $status
